📌 Prediction on Rock and Mine
🚀 Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify whether a given input represents a rock or a mine based on its features. The model is trained using a dataset containing sonar signals, where it learns to differentiate between the two categories.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn


📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains sonar readings that help classify objects as either rock or mine.
Features include numerical values representing sonar signal intensities.
The dataset is preprocessed before training the model.
📈 Model & Approach
Preprocessing: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
Training: Utilized machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.
Evaluation: Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
